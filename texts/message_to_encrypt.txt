My name is Chukwunazaekpere Obioma and I'm an Igbo-Biafran.
Between 1967, to 1970, the british, america, egyptians, soviet, malians etc 
were allied and killed over three million of my people.
Every single article making-up the Geneva convention of 1949 were disrespected, 
as my people suffered all manner of war crimes.
Yes, We manufactured our weapons (one of the reasons why I'm proud of my fathers), 
to withstand the war; however, the enemies had to resort to starvation, 
since they couldn't win by millitary strategies and combat alone.
We're here, to make everyone who brought pains on my people, feel & taste the same pains.
